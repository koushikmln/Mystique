        <ol>
            <li>The competition has 30 levels of mindboggling cryptic connects.</li>
            <li>Each level is worth points equal to level number. Thus Level 0 is worth 0 points, level 1 is worth 1 ,and level 30 is worth 30 points.</li>
            <li>At the end of the hunt , the participant with most points and least time wins.</li>
            <li>The hunt allows you a total of three 'skips', described below in the section SKIP.</li>
            <li>While answering there should not be any spaces and the letters should be lowercase. 'Lord Brahma' is wrong. It should be 'lordbrahma'. No special characters are allowed.</li>
            <li>Do have a look at the source code. Especially look out for the term 'hint' in the page.</li>
            <li>The name of the images can be a big hint sometimes.</li>
            <li>Google is your best friend. Don't be shy to use lots of search engines.</li>
            <li>Be decent on forums. Remember this is a competition and ruining any question by sharing answers is prohibited. Everyone is being monitored. Any discrepancies will imply immediate disqualification.</li>
            <li>At the time of giving prizes we reserve the right to ask for your identification.</li>
            <li>Any suspicious activity like sharing answers or solving together will get you banned from the website or disqualified and barred from getting any prize/goodies.</li>
            <li>The decision made by Admins would be final. SKIP Skip means that if you get stuck on a level you can hop to the next level by using the skip button. This can only be done thrice in the competition.</li>
            <li>However, here's the catch. If you hop a level you also lose all the points for that level and you also can't go back to that level.</li>
            <li>You cannot skip any level after level 20.</li>
