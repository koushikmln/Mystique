            <li> The competition has a bazillion levels of mindboggling cryptic connects.</li>
            <li>  Each level is worth points equal to level number. Thus Level 0 is worth 0 points, level 1 is worth 1, and level 30 is worth 30 points.</li>
            <li> At the end of the hunt, the participant with most points and least time wins.</li>
            <li> The hunt allows you a total of three 'skips', described below in the section SKIP.</li>
            <li> While answering there should not be any spaces and the letters should be lowercase. 'Lord Brahma' is wrong. It should be 'lordbrahma'. No special characters are allowed. Numbers are allowed.</li>
            <li> Hints will be regularly posted on the Forum. Keep checking it. Also, check out the section HINTS.</li>
            <li> The name of the images can be a big hint sometimes.</li>
            <li> Google is your best friend. Don't be shy to use lots of search engines.</li>
            <li> Be decent on forums. Remember this is a competition and ruining any question by sharing answers is prohibited. Everyone is being monitored. Any discrepancies will imply immediate disqualification.</li>
            <li> At the time of giving prizes we reserve the right to ask for your identification.</li>
            <li> Any suspicious activity like sharing answers or solving together will get you banned from the website or disqualified and barred from getting any prize/goodies.</li>
            <li> The decision made by Admins (All Hail The Great and Powerful Admins) would be final.</li>

          <h4>SKIP</h4>
          Skip means that if you get stuck on a level you can hop to the next level by using the skip button. This can only be done thrice in the competition.
          <ul>
            <li>However, here's the catch. If you hop a level you also lose all the points for that level and you also can't go back to that level.</li>
            <li> You cannot skip any level after level 20.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>HINTS</h4>
          <p>We, the Kind and Helpful Admins, have decided to give you participants HINTS, that may help you out on your quest.</p>
          <p>Hints will be made available in two forms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anywhere, yes ANYWHERE, on the page. We are devious.</li>
            <li>In the source code, to be viewed <strong>ONLY VIA THE "INSPECT ELEMENT" FEATURE</strong> on your browsers.
              <p>Right-click on the page and you should find the "Inspect Element" option. Use that to view the source code.</p>
            </li>
